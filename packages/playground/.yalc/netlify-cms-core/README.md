# Docs coming soon!

Netlify CMS was recently converted from a single npm package to a "monorepo" of over 20 packages.
That's over 20 Readme's! We haven't created one for this package yet, but we will soon.

In the meantime, you can:

1. Check out the [main readme](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/#readme) or the [documentation
   site](https://www.netlifycms.org) for more info.
2. Reach out to the [community chat](https://netlifycms.org/chat/) if you need help.
3. Help out and [write the readme yourself](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/edit/master/packages/netlify-cms-core/README.md)!
